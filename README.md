### Quick Start

Run `demo.py` to test LogSummary on `SSH_10k` dataset.

folder `data` contains the datasets for training and testing. (Full datasets can be obtained from `LogHub`.)

Folder `label` contains the structured logs obtained from `LogHub`, the groundtruth used for header extraction and variable mapping.

Folder `logsum` and `utils` contain the source code.

Folder `result` contains the structured logs (model output) and the log templates.
